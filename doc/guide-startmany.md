#start-many Setup Guide

## Two Options for Setting up your Wallet
There are many ways to setup a wallet to support start-many. This guide will walk through two of them.

1. [Importing an existing wallet (recommended if you are consolidating wallets).](#option1)
2. [Sending 1,000 DSLK to new wallet addresses.](#option2)

## <a name="option1"></a>Option 1. Importing an existing wallet

This is the way to go if you are consolidating multiple wallets into one that supports start-many. 

### From your single-instance Stormnode Wallet

Open your QT Wallet and go to console (from the menu select Tools => Debug Console)

Dump the private key from your Stormnode's pulic key.

```
walletpassphrase [your_wallet_passphrase] 600
dumpprivkey [sn_public_key]
```

Copy the resulting priviate key. You'll use it in the next step.

### From your multi-instance Stormnode Wallet

Open your QT Wallet and go to console (from the menu select Tools => Debug Console)

Import the private key from the step above.

```
walletpassphrase [your_wallet_passphrase] 600
importprivkey [single_instance_private_key]
```

The wallet will re-scan and you will see your available balance increase by the amount that was in the imported wallet.

[Skip Option 2. and go to Create stormnode.conf file](#stormnodeconf)

## <a name="option2"></a>Option 2. Starting with a new wallet

[If you used Option 1 above, then you can skip down to Create stormnode.conf file.](#stormnodeconf)

### Create New Wallet Addresses

1. Open the QT Wallet.
2. Click the Receive tab.
3. Fill in the form to request a payment.
    * Label: sn01
    * Amount: 1000 (optional)
    * Click *Request payment*
5. Click the *Copy Address* button

Create a new wallet address for each Stormnode.

Close your QT Wallet.

### Send 1,000 DSLK to New Addresses

Just like setting up a standard SN. Send exactly 1,000 DSLK to each new address created above.

### Create New Stormnode Private Keys

Open your QT Wallet and go to console (from the menu select Tools => Debug Console)

Issue the following:

```stormnode genkey```

*Note: A Stormnode private key will need to be created for each Stormnode you run. You should not use the same Stormnode private key for multiple Stormnodes.*

Close your QT Wallet.

## <a name="stormnodeconf"></a>Create stormnode.conf file

Remember... this is local. Make sure your QT is not running.

Create the stormnode.conf file in the same directory as your wallet.dat.

Copy the Stormnode private key and correspondig collateral output transaction that holds the 1K DARKSILK.

The Stormnode private key may be an existing key from [Option 1](#option1), or a newly generated key from [Option 2](#option2). 

*Please note, the Stormnode priviate key is not the same as a wallet private key. Never put your wallet private key in the stormnode.conf file. That is equivalent to putting your 1,000 DSLK on the remote server and defeats the purpose of a hot/cold setup.*

### Get the collateral output

Open your QT Wallet and go to console (from the menu select Tools => Debug Console)

Issue the following:

```stormnode outputs```

Make note of the hash (which is your collaterla_output) and index.

### Enter your Stormnode details into your stormnode.conf file
[From the darksilk github repo](https://github.com/silknetwork/darksilk-core/blob/master/doc/stormnode_conf.md)

The new stormnode.conf format consists of a space seperated text file. Each line consisting of an alias, IP address followed by port, Stormnode private key, collateral output transaction id and collateral output index. 
(!!! Currently not implemented: "donation address and donation percentage (the latter two are optional and should be in format "address:percentage")." !!!)

```
alias ipaddress:port stormnode_private_key collateral_output collateral_output_index (!!! see above "donationin_address:donation_percentage" !!!)
```



Example:

```
sn01 127.0.0.1:31600 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0
sn02 127.0.0.2:31600 93WaAb3htPJEV8E9aQcN23Jt97bPex7YvWfgMDTUdWJvzmrMqey aa9f1034d973377a5e733272c3d0eced1de22555ad45d6b24abadff8087948d4 0 (!!! see above "7gnwGHt17heGpG9Crfeh4KGpYNFugPhJdh:25" !!!)
```

## What about the darksilk.conf file?

If you are using a stormnode.conf file you no longer need the darksilk.conf file. The exception is if you need custom settings (thanks oblox). 

## Update darksilk.conf on server

If you generated a new Stormnode private key, you will need to update the remote darksilk.conf files.

Shut down the daemon and then edit the file.

```sudo nano .darksilk/darksilk.conf```

### Edit the stormnodeprivkey
If you generated a new Stormnode private key, you will need to update the stormnodeprivkey value in your remote darksilk.conf file.

## Start your Stormnodes

### Remote

If your remote server is not running, start your remote daemon as you normally would. 

I usually confirm that remote is on the correct block by issuing:

```darksilkd getinfo```

And compare with the official explorer at http://explorer.darksilkpay.io/chain/DarkSilk

### Local

Finally... time to start from local.

#### Open up your QT Wallet

From the menu select Tools => Debug Console

If you want to review your stormnode.conf setting before starting the Stormnodes, issue the following in the Debug Console:

```stormnode list-conf```

Give it the eye-ball test. If satisfied, you can start your nodes one of two ways.

1. stormnode start-alias [alias_from_stormnode.conf]. Example ```stormnode start-alias sn01```
2. stormnode start-many
